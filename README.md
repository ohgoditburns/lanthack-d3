# lanthack-d3

This d3 effort does a few things:

1. Hiveplot display of 3 publications (Economist, Jacobin, WND) with links if a topicmodel correlation between documents is > 0.95.
2. Clicking on a hiveplot node will show in a separate panel that node and all connected nodes. This was intended to be shown as a graphical network with links, but... that's hackathons!
3. Clicking on a node in the graph panel will open the article in a new page. Note that the Economist requires a subscription and will only let you see something like 10 articles a month.
